## Introduction

Big data. It’s the buzz word. It’s something we recognize as important to driving and creating trust in our decision making process. We generate data quickly and in significant amounts, 
but it’s complicated — and quickly overwhelming. In 2017 the Harvard Business Review reported that:

- “…less than half of an organization’s structured data is actively used in decision making…
- 80% of an analyst’s time is spent discovering and preparing data, and …
- An [organization’s] technology often isn’t up to the demands put on it …”  

As a team who uses “all readily available and credible data” throughout the state, navigating and solving the challenges of working with big datasets from 
disparate data sources is something we continuously have to navigate. Through the Department’s first continuous improvement efforts, the Integrated Report’s (IR) Programming Team 
worked on re-evaluating and -imagining how we use technology to visualize and overcome the challenges with big data. We set out to become more efficient, agile, and credible 
in our decision making processes when reporting on the quality of the state’s surface waters. This summary discusses the challenges and successes from the IR team’s continuous 
improvements efforts over the last three years.
