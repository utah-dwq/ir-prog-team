## Accessing data
The first and often most time consuming challenge of any water quality data analysis is finding and aggregating appropriate data. This may include ambient water quality monitoring, 
permitted discharge, and stream flow data. The IR programming team has developed tools to find and read relevant water quality data from AWQMS, the EPA Water Quality Portal, EPA ECHO, 
and USGS NWIS databases. Each of these databases are web-services enabled. The tools developed by the IR programming team are designed to read data based on user specified query attributes, 
such as assessment unit, HUC boundary, site or permit identifiers, and parameters directly to an R workspace so that it can be rapidly updated and requeried in a repeatable manner directly 
within an analytical workflow. One of the unique attributes of this toolset is the ability to view and select sites for data queries from multiple water quality databases in an integrated manner.
